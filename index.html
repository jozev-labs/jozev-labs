      <h3>Why Teams Hire Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hiring managers bring me in when projects stall between concept and execution.
        I specialize in reducing ambiguity, aligning technical decisions with business needs,
        and delivering prototypes that teams can confidently build on.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background spans solutions engineering, developer advocacy, and product-facing roles.
        This allows me to communicate clearly with engineers, product managers, and non-technical stakeholders
        without losing accuracy or momentum.
