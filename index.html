      <h2>Solutions Engineer · Technical Prototyping · System Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        I help teams move from abstract ideas to working technical solutions.
        My focus is prototyping, systems thinking, and building foundations that scale.

        <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          I build functional prototypes to validate assumptions early,
          reduce technical risk, and align stakeholders before heavy investment.

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h3>How I Work</h3>
      <p>
        I approach engineering pragmatically.
        Prototype early. Test assumptions. Make systems understandable.
        Prefer clarity over clever abstractions and solutions teams can actually maintain.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prototype first to remove ambiguity</li>
        <li>Design systems, not isolated features</li>
        <li>Communicate clearly across technical and non-technical teams</li>
      </ul>
