        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Solutions Engineer and technical consultant focused on turning ambiguous ideas
          into working systems. My strength lies in rapid prototyping, system architecture,
          and translating business needs into practical technical decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work at the intersection of engineering, product, and stakeholders.
          This allows me to reduce uncertainty early, validate assumptions through prototypes,
          and design solutions teams can confidently take to production.

        <h3>How I Work</h3>
        <p>
          I prioritize clarity, speed, and maintainability.
          Prototypes exist to answer questions, not to impress.
          Systems should be understandable by the people who inherit them.
